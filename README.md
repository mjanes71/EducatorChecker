# EducatorChecker

This was a side project I spun up to learn more about Selenium. I followed a tutorial to learn how to take a screenshot of a website after I entered some text into a text field. I then revamped the code to:

-Navigate to the ODE teacher search website
-Search for a particular teacher ID (learned about the importance to implicit waits here
-Scroll to a particular section (learned about the difference between a sleep and a wait here as well as a javascript executor)
-Created helper methods to abstract some of the functionality of my code

To continue adding to this/learning from this in the future I could:
-Compile all the screenshots into an email and send that to myself
-Gather screenshots from other sites to build a more comprehensive "review" of an educator

*The use case for this side project was to automate a "quick check" that is often done by HR in school districts when reviewing educator resumes.
